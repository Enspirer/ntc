00:00:01.600 --> 00:00:04.900
Reducing pollution in a farm’s water supply…

2
00:00:04.900 --> 00:00:06.733
Improving the efficiency of a

3
00:00:06.733 --> 00:00:08.799
rural electric power system…

4
00:00:08.800 --> 00:00:10.800
Discovering a new way to extend

5
00:00:10.800 --> 00:00:12.400
the life of a tomato…

6
00:00:12.400 --> 00:00:13.766
These are some of the projects

7
00:00:13.766 --> 00:00:16.032
an agricultural engineer might work on

8
00:00:16.033 --> 00:00:18.999
in the quest to make agricultural operations

9
00:00:19.000 --> 00:00:22.000
as efficient and productive as possible.

10
00:00:22.000 --> 00:00:24.833
Most agricultural engineers work in offices,

11
00:00:24.833 --> 00:00:27.233
with frequent research visits to farms,

12
00:00:27.233 --> 00:00:29.466
labs or rural areas.

13
00:00:29.466 --> 00:00:31.266
They work for government offices,

14
00:00:31.266 --> 00:00:32.399
engineering firms,

15
00:00:32.400 --> 00:00:34.800
universities and manufacturers.

16
00:00:34.800 --> 00:00:37.333
The ultimate goal for these engineers is to

17
00:00:37.333 --> 00:00:40.166
improve crop and livestock production.

18
00:00:40.166 --> 00:00:42.332
This career focuses on the design and

19
00:00:42.333 --> 00:00:43.933
manufacture of the equipment

20
00:00:43.933 --> 00:00:47.466
and facilities needed to reach that goal.

21
00:00:47.466 --> 00:00:50.032
Agricultural engineers examine the impact of

22
00:00:50.033 --> 00:00:51.466
plant and food production

23
00:00:51.466 --> 00:00:53.099
on the greater environment,

24
00:00:53.100 --> 00:00:56.100
and look for ways to reduce negative impacts.

25
00:00:56.100 --> 00:00:58.433
Sometimes they even make news headlines

26
00:00:58.433 --> 00:01:00.733
with breakthroughs on production techniques,

27
00:01:00.733 --> 00:01:03.966
such as genetic engineering and cloning.

28
00:01:03.966 --> 00:01:06.532
Agricultural engineers need an aptitude for

29
00:01:06.533 --> 00:01:08.366
science and technology,

30
00:01:08.366 --> 00:01:10.066
along with good oral and written

31
00:01:10.066 --> 00:01:11.899
communication skills.

32
00:01:11.900 --> 00:01:13.833
They rely heavily on their ability to

33
00:01:13.833 --> 00:01:16.099
recognize and solve problems.

34
00:01:16.100 --> 00:01:18.300
A bachelor’s degree in agricultural

35
00:01:18.300 --> 00:01:20.300
or biological engineering is the

36
00:01:20.300 --> 00:01:22.600
entry-level education needed.

37
00:01:22.600 --> 00:01:25.633
As the world population continues to expand,

38
00:01:25.633 --> 00:01:28.433
the need for the work of agricultural engineers

39
00:01:28.433 --> 00:01:30.999
will only continue to grow.
